    It is my great fortune to have spent 4 years at the University of Wisconsin-Madison,
    in which I have met so many wonderful professors and peers. The following are some of the
    courses that I loved most. Order is arranged by the time I took them.

    Probably the most surprising thing about UW-Madison is the math department.
    Once beyond the introductory courses (Cal 1-3) or in the honor series, a typical class size is about 30 students.
    A significant portion of the undergraduate advanced level courses will be taught by
    Professor with title <i>Van Vleck Visiting Assistant Professor</i>, which is a postdoctoral position.
    This allows the department to offer almost all (popular) upper-level courses every semester.

    Math 341: Linear Algebra (Honors)

    This is the first proof-based math course I took.
    Professor Angenent is a very nice person and a great teacher. He is very patient and
    knowledgeable. He retired after a year I took his course.

    Because this is a course that supposed to be the first proof-based math course for many students,
    we are going through the material very slowly. The textbook we used is <i>Linear Algebra Done Wrong</i> 
    by Sergei Treil, a very interesting
    book that define (interpret) matrix multiplication as linear function composition.

    There are an alternative version of this course (proof-based): Math 375-376, which would cover Linear Algebra,
    Calculus 3, and Differential Equations in one year.
